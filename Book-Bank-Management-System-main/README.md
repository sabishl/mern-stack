**Project Name:** **Book Bank Management System**

**Technologies Used:** MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

**Project Overview:** The Book Bank Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the management of online e-books. The platform allows users to browse, borrow, and manage e-books efficiently. Users can sign up by providing essential details such as name, email, password, and address, which are securely stored in MongoDB. Once registered, users can log in to access the dashboard, which features an overview of available e-books, borrowing history, and user profile information. The dashboard also includes intuitive navigation for easy access to different sections of the website.

**Features:**

**E-Book Catalog:** Users can browse through a catalog of available e-books, view details, and borrow them. Borrowed books are tracked in the user's history for easy management.
  
**Search and Filter:** Users can search for specific books by title, author, or genre, and apply filters to narrow down their search results.

**User Profile Management:** Users can update their personal details, view their borrowing history, and manage their account settings.

**Challenges:**

**Online Payment Security:** Implementing secure online payment gateways for purchasing premium e-books posed a significant challenge, requiring robust encryption and compliance with security standards.

**Data Management:** Ensuring the integrity and consistency of data across the platform, especially during high-volume transactions, was a key technical challenge.
